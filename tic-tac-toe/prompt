Tic-Tac-Toe game AI using the minimax algorithm.
Implemented using python
Must be able to play against the player
Three possible board moves: X, O, or E (Empty)
Board state should be represented as a string of 9 characters (3x3 board) consisting of X, O, or E
Should be able to configure three levels of difficulty
Easy: AI makes random moves
Medium: AI makes random moves, but blocks the player from winning
Hard: AI uses the minimax algorithm to determine the best move
Class signature as follows: """
class AI:
    def __init__(self, name, symbol):
        self.name = name
        self.symbol = symbol

    def get_best_move(self, board_state):
        # Implement minimax algorithm to determine the best move
        pass
"""
