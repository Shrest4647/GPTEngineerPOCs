Based on the requirements and assumptions, here is the proposed architecture for the tic tac toe game:

1. `game.py`: The entrypoint file that initializes the game and handles the game loop.
2. `board.py`: Contains the `Board` class that represents the game board and provides methods for updating and checking the board state.
3. `player.py`: Contains the `Player` class that represents a player and provides methods for making moves.
4. `ai.py`: Contains the `AI` class that represents the AI opponent and implements the minimax algorithm for making optimal moves.
5. `database.py`: Contains the `Database` class that handles the SQLite database operations for saving and retrieving game state and history.
6. `scoreboard.py`: Contains the `Scoreboard` class that keeps track of wins and losses for each player.
7. `constants.py`: Contains constant values used throughout the game.

Now let's proceed with implementing the code for each file.

`game.py`
