Based on the requirements and assumptions, the following core classes, functions, and methods will be necessary:

1. `ChatbotAPI` class:
   - `__init__(self, api_key: str)`: Initializes the ChatbotAPI object with the provided API key.
   - `send_message(self, message: str) -> str`: Sends a message to the chatbot API and returns the response as a string.

2. `TextToSpeech` class:
   - `__init__(self)`: Initializes the TextToSpeech object.
   - `speak(self, text: str)`: Converts the given text to speech and speaks it out loud.

3. `CommandLineApp` class:
   - `__init__(self, chatbot_api: ChatbotAPI, text_to_speech: TextToSpeech)`: Initializes the CommandLineApp object with the chatbot API and text-to-speech objects.
   - `run(self)`: Starts the command line application and waits for user input.
   - `process_command(self, command: str)`: Processes the user command and performs the necessary actions.

Now, let's proceed with creating the necessary files and implementing the code.

**1. chatbot_api.py**

```python
import openai

class ChatbotAPI:
    def __init__(self, api_key: str):
        openai.api_key = api_key

    def send_message(self, message: str) -> str:
        response = openai.Completion.create(
            engine="text-davinci-003",
            prompt=message,
            max_tokens=50,
            temperature=0.7,
            n=1,
            stop=None,
            timeout=10,
        )
        return response.choices[0].text.strip()
```

**2. text_to_speech.py**

```python
import pyttsx3

class TextToSpeech:
    def __init__(self):
        self.engine = pyttsx3.init()

    def speak(self, text: str):
        self.engine.say(text)
        self.engine.runAndWait()
```

**3. command_line_app.py**

```python
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from chatbot_api import ChatbotAPI
from text_to_speech import TextToSpeech

class CommandLineApp:
    def __init__(self, chatbot_api: ChatbotAPI, text_to_speech: TextToSpeech):
        self.chatbot_api = chatbot_api
        self.text_to_speech = text_to_speech

    def run(self):
        while True:
            command = input("Enter a command: ")
            self.process_command(command)

    def process_command(self, command: str):
        if command.lower() == "bye bye":
            print("Goodbye!")
            exit()

        response = self.chatbot_api.send_message(command)
        if response.lower() == "skip":
            print("Skipping the current response...")
            return

        self.text_to_speech.speak(response)

# Load environment variables from .env file
load_dotenv()

# Get the API key from environment variables
api_key = os.getenv("API_KEY")

# Create instances of ChatbotAPI and TextToSpeech
chatbot_api = ChatbotAPI(api_key)
text_to_speech = TextToSpeech()

# Create an instance of CommandLineApp and run the application
app = CommandLineApp(chatbot_api, text_to_speech)
app.run()
```

**4. requirements.txt**

```
openai
python-dotenv
pyttsx3
```

Please note that the code provided assumes that the `openai`, `python-dotenv`, and `pyttsx3` libraries are installed. You can install them by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

Make sure to replace the `API_KEY` placeholder in the `.env` file with your actual API key.

This architecture includes the necessary classes and functions to implement a command line application that interacts with the ChatGPT API and uses text-to-speech to speak the responses. The code is organized into separate files, following best practices for Python development.
