Based on the requirements and assumptions, the following core classes, functions, and methods will be necessary:

1. `ChatbotAPI` class:
   - `__init__(self, api_key: str)`: Initializes the ChatbotAPI object with the provided API key.
   - `send_message(self, message: str) -> str`: Sends a message to the chatbot API and returns the response as a string.

2. `TextToSpeech` class:
   - `__init__(self)`: Initializes the TextToSpeech object.
   - `speak(self, text: str)`: Converts the given text to speech and speaks it out loud.

3. `CommandLineApp` class:
   - `__init__(self, chatbot_api: ChatbotAPI, text_to_speech: TextToSpeech)`: Initializes the CommandLineApp object with the chatbot API and text-to-speech objects.
   - `run(self)`: Starts the command line application and waits for user input.
   - `process_command(self, command: str)`: Processes the user command and performs the necessary actions.

Now, let's proceed with creating the necessary files and implementing the code.

**1. chatbot_api.py**
