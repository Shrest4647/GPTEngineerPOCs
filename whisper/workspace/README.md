Based on the requirements, here are the core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary:

1. `SpeechToTextTranscriber` class:
   - `__init__(self, codeword_start: str, codeword_end: str, idle_timeout: int, language: str, accent: str)`
     - Initializes the SpeechToTextTranscriber with the provided parameters.
   - `start_transcribing(self)`
     - Starts the transcription process.
   - `stop_transcribing(self)`
     - Stops the transcription process.
   - `listen_for_codewords(self)`
     - Listens for the codewords "Whisper" and "Bye Bye" to start and stop transcribing.
   - `transcribe(self, audio: bytes) -> str`
     - Transcribes the provided audio using OpenAI's Whisper API.
   - `save_transcription(self, transcription: str)`
     - Saves the transcribed text to a file with a timestamped filename.

2. `MicrophoneListener` class:
   - `__init__(self)`
     - Initializes the MicrophoneListener.
   - `listen(self) -> bytes`
     - Listens to the microphone and returns the recorded audio as bytes.

Now let's proceed with the implementation of the code.
